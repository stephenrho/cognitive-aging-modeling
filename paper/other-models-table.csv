Multinomial processing tree models of source monitoring,"To judge the source of previously studied information or whether a test probe is a new lure participants are assumed to enter distinct cognitive states in sequence. For example, they may detect that a particular probe is old but then fail to detect the source of the probe in which case they would have to guess between sources. This is in contrast to SDT in which participants are assumed to monitor a continuous decision variable (e.g., familiarity) and not enter a discrete detect/not-detect state.","Bayen, Murnane and Erdfelder (1996); Meiser and Br√∂der (2002); Boywitt, Kuhlmann, and  Meiser (2012)","Threshold models of signal detection (Snodgrass \& Corwin, 1988). Dual process model of recollection and familiarity (Yonelinas, 1994). Models of the capacity of working memory (Rouder, Morey, Morey, \& Cowan, 2011)."
Diffusion model of choice reaction time and accuracy,"In two-choice decision tasks participants are assumed to accumulate information (corrupted by noise) and respond when there is strong enough evidence in favor of a particular response. There are parameters that control the rate of accumulation, bias towards particular responses, and time spent not making the decision (encoding, output). This model simultaneously fits reaction time and accuracy data.",Ratcliff (1978); Ratcliff and McKoon (2008),"Linear ballistic accumulator model (Brown \& Heathcote, 2008). EZ-diffusion (Wagenmakers, Van Der Maas, \& Grasman, 2007)"
Mixture model of recall error,"Participants are cued to recall a particular feature (e.g., color, orientation, location) as precisely as possible. Recall error, or the distance between the studied and recalled feature, is assumed to reflect a mixture of guesses and true recall from memory with some precision. Some models also assume that participants occasionally erroneously recall a feature associated with another cue.","Zhang and Luck (2008); Bays, Catalao, and Husain (2009); Rhodes, Abbene, Meierhofer, and Naveh-Benjamin (2020); Souza (2016)","Variable precision model (Van den Berg, Shin, Chou, George, \& Ma, 2012).
