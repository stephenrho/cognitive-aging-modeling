Syntax,Explanation
\texttt{int<lower=1> N;},\texttt{N} is an integer (int) and cannot be lower than 1
\texttt{int y[N];},"\texttt{y} contains \texttt{N} integers and \texttt{y} is an array (arrays are different from vectors and matrices, which are limited to one and two dimensions, respectively)"
"\texttt{int<lower=1,upper=J> id[N];}",\texttt{id} contains \texttt{N} integers that must be between 1 and \texttt{J} (where \texttt{J} is also an integer)
\texttt{1:(K-1)},"produces a sequence of integers between 1 and \texttt{K}-1 (e.g., if \texttt{K} is 6 the result would be \texttt{[1,2,3,4,5]})"
"\texttt{matrix[N, 2] X;}",\texttt{X} is a matrix with \texttt{N} rows and 2 columns
\texttt{vector[N] sig\_trial;},\texttt{sig\_trial} is a vector of \texttt{N} numbers
\texttt{real b\_d[J];},\texttt{b\_d} is an array of \texttt{J} numbers that can take any value
\texttt{real<lower=0> tau\_d;},\texttt{tau\_d} is a single number that can take any value of 0 or greater
\texttt{for (i in 1:N)\{ \ldots \}},produce a sequence of integers between 1 and \texttt{N} and for each integer (\texttt{i}) in this sequence run the code between the braces (note \texttt{i} is often used by convention but doesn’t have to be)
\texttt{x = 1;},\texttt{x} is assigned the value of 1
"\texttt{x \textasciitilde{} normal(0, 1);}",\texttt{x} is assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1
"\texttt{b[i] = dot\_product(X[i,], B\_b) }",the element of \texttt{b} in position \texttt{i} is equal to the dot product of row \texttt{i} of matrix \texttt{X} and \texttt{B\_d}
\texttt{b\_b[id[i]];},find the \texttt{id} of the participant that observation \texttt{i} comes from (\texttt{id[i]}) and use this to select the value of \texttt{b\_b} corresponding to that \texttt{id}
\texttt{y[i] \textasciitilde{} categorical(theta[i]);},element \texttt{i} of \texttt{y} is sampled from a categorical distribution with probabilities determined by element \texttt{i} of \texttt{theta}
\texttt{exp(log(k) – log(K))},"if \texttt{k} and \texttt{K} are integers the result of \texttt{k\/K} will also be an integer, which is not what we want when setting the unbiased criteria of the SDT model. Subtracting the logarithms and taking the exponent produces the non-integer result we desire"
